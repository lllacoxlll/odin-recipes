  <p>
    The default yeild of this recipe from Nagi of Recipetineats is 10-12 servings, and you'll still wish you'd made more
    after cooking this. This is a recipe that you start off cooking in the slow cooker and finish off in a pan in order
    to get a perfect texture of crispy yet tender.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>2 kg / 4 lb pork shoulder (pork butt), skinless, boneless</li>
    <li>2 1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 jalapeno, deseeded, chopped</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>3/4 cup juice from orange (2 oranges)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Rinse and dry the pork shoulder, rub all over with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Combine the oregano, cumin, and olive oil and then rub all over the pork.</li>
    <li>Place the pork in a slow cooker (fat cap up), top with the onion, jalapeño, minced garlic (don’t worry about
      spreading
      it) and squeeze over the juice of the oranges.</li>
    <li>Slow Cook on low for 10 hours or on high for 7 hours.</li>
    <li>Pork should be tender enough to shred. Remove from slow cooker and let cool slightly. Then shred using two
      forks.</li>
    <li>If you have a lot more than 2 cups of juice, then reduce it down to about 2 cups. The liquid will be salty, it
      is the
      seasoning for the pork. Set liquid aside – don’t bother straining onion etc, it’s super soft.</li>
    <li>Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large non stick pan or well seasoned skillet over high heat. Spread pork in the pan,
      drizzle
      over some juices. Wait until the juices evaporate and the bottom side is golden brown and crusty. Turn and just
      briefly
      sear the other side – you don’t want to make it brown all over because then it’s too crispy, need tender juicy
      bits.</li>
    <li>Remove pork from skillet. Repeat in batches (takes me 4 batches) – don’t crowd the pan.</li>
    <li>Just before serving, drizzle over more juices and serve hot, stuffed in tacos (see notes for sides, other
      serving
      suggestion and storage/make ahead).</li>
  </ol>
